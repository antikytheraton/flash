# flash

Inspired by a reddit post sometime ago.  

A script to flash the caps lock led. In morse code. Because who honestly uses the capslock button.  
Probably needs sudo permissions.  
Might not work on your machine.  

### Usage

- Clone the repo.
- cd into the directory  
```
cd flash
```
- Run it

```bash
sudo python3 flash "message"
```
